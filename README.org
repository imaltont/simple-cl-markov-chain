* Simple Markov chain
Simple Markov chain text generator written in Common Lisp. Doesn't do any weighting or heuristics to improve anything, or accept prompts, just generates semi-random text based on the input.

Run with
#+begin_quote
sbcl --load "mc.lisp" --eval "(format t \"~a~&\" (markov \"data.txt\" 3 50))" --eval "(sb-ext:exit)"
#+end_quote
